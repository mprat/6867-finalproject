\section{Introduction}

* CNNs have proven effective in image classification because of the ability to learn high-level features
* CNN is like a multiclass perceptron?
	* start with a single multiclass logistic regression classifier in caffe on SUN
* http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/SUN/
* neural networks are really networks of logistic regression things
* multiclass logistic regression on SUN database

* can use the dataset that is already on aditya's folder: 
/data/vision/torralba/aditya_datasets/data/SUN397/SUN397

1. simple logistic regression classifier: network example given here http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/tutorial/net_layer_blob.html

\section{Method}

* had to install caffe
* mostly used resources online, except the built-in ATLAS on my OSX machine was not working, so had to add openblas to teh list of brew packages needed to be edited / installed / compiled
